Hi, I am Kxnstrxktiv.   

My main goal is to make Windows (mainly win10) more useful through enabling extra/hidden features and disabling unneeded ones.
I like to Tweak windows so it runs smoother while not affecting your security in a negative way.   

Currently working on my own Tweaking Utility: WINCL
